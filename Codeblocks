 1.what is it?
    Personally, it is the uddate of Turbo C++, help me run the code and found the mistake easier the the Turbo C++

2.How does it work?
     Open the program or website where you can write code.
You need to find and open the place where you can type your instructions. Itâ€™s like opening a coloring book or a drawing paper before you start drawing.

     Find the button or menu that says "Code Blocks" or "Add Code".
Look for a special button that helps you make a code box. It might look like a little rectangle or a button that says "Code".

      Click or tap on that button to make a new code box.
When you press the button, a new empty box will appear where you can write your instructions.
